Process Destroyer: The Oneclick Continuer. ðŸ˜Ž 

Process Destroyer's primary goal is to debloat things Oneclick, couldn't do without elevated privileges!
Leading to an outstanding reduction off processes ontop of what oneclick already does.

**Requirements:**
*Process Destroyer is required to be ran on a system that installed windows with an offline/Local account, other wise you'll get a blank screen when logging in.
This means it only applies to those did an offline install/Method, Meaning you did not under no circumstances login into a microsoft account when setting up windows. 
It does not matter if you're current logged into a offline/local accouunt or it displayes that you are, regardless you needed to do the offline install/Method upon setting up windows.
It's also heavily recommended you install all you're necessary apps & programs, along side you're Gpu Driver & most importantly [Dcontrol](https://www.sordum.org/9480/defender-control-v2-1/) first.
Also Make sure to run Oneclick with or alongside Process Destroyer.*
