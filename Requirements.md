# Please Read Carefully!

**Requirements:**
Process Destroyer is required to be ran on a system that installed windows with an [Offline/Local Account](https://github.com/QuakedK/Process-Destroyer/edit/main/README.md#offlinelocal-account-tutorial).
Meaning you did not, under no circumstances login into a microsoft account when setting up windows. 
It does not matter if you're currently logged into a [Offline/Local Account](https://github.com/QuakedK/Process-Destroyer/edit/main/README.md#offlinelocal-account-tutorial) or it displayes that you are, you needed to have setup/installed windows without an online account. 
All necessary Apps, Programs, Drivers and Gpu Drivers should be installed before running Process Destroyer, it's also recommended Windows Defender is disabled.
Any failure to met the requirements to be on a an offline/Local account, will result in a black screen when logging in.
